## Introduction to R
- There are so many cool things you can do

- Today is not an exhaustive list, more about dipping your toes in the water

- Won't be a deep dive into *how* to use R, more *what* you can use it for

- Hopefully once inspired you will be motivated to go out on your own

## Lets start at the very beginning...
- *R* is the language *R Studio* is the IDE 
 
- It is open-source (i.e. free) and available at http://www.rstudio.com/

<center><img src="./images/rstudio_ed.jpeg" height="450px" width="650px" /></center>


---
## A quick look see
<center><img src="images/rstudio.jpeg" height="450px" width="650px" /></center>
- To learn how to navigate R studio I think the best place to start is this video (https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/)

---
## Packages
- The real power of R comes through it's packages

- Packages are fundamental units of reproducible R code. 

- They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data


<center><img src="images/R_packages.jpeg" height="250px" width="500px"/></center>

- Step 1: Look on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Step 2: See if the author wrote a package vignette
- Step 3: Google it (always your friend!)

---
## Tidyverse
- The Tidyverse is created by Hadley Wickham ( R Pirate Captain!)
- Collection of packages designed with the sole purpose of making your life easier.

```{r intro to packages, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")
library (tidyverse)

```

The goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

- Every column is variable.
- Every row is an observation.
- Every cell is a single value.

<center><img src="images/data_struc.jpeg" height="250px" width="500px"/></center>

---
## Data types and structure

- Everything in R is an object.

<center><img src="images/data_type.jpeg" height="350px" width="500px"/></center>
- Lots of useful functions to check what you are working with
  + class() - what kind of object is it (high-level)?
  + typeof() - what is the object’s data type (low-level)?
  + length() - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
  + attributes() - does it have any metadata?

---
## Import your data
- R can import data from lots of existing formats
  + **haven** for SPSS, Stata, and SAS data.
  + **httr** for web APIs.
  + **readxl** for .xls and .xlsx sheets.
  + **rvest** for web scraping.
  + **jsonlite** for JSON. 

- Once in R, it is called a dataframe 
<center><img src="images/data_frame1.jpeg" height="300px" width="550px" /></center>

---

## Wrangle your data
- No matter how much effort we put into database design the nature of data is that it is often messy

- The tidyverse includes packages specifically designed to help with the job 

  + lubridate for dates and date-times.
  + stringr for working with strings
  + forcats for working with categorical variables
  + hms for time-of-day values.

- Helps clean/organise your data into the right format prior to plotting/analysis

# Wrangle your data (cont)...
- It's likely you will be working with a big dataset

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
load("~/Documents/PHD-Data-Analysis/PHD-Data-Analysis/Analysis/Data/COMBINED_COG_PhD.Rdata")
```

```{r, eval= TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::kable(COMBINED_COG_PhD[1:12, 1:10], "html")

dim(COMBINED_COG_PhD)

df<-glimpse(COMBINED_COG_PhD)

knitr::kable(df[1:12, 1:10], "html")
```
---

# So dplyr is your best of friends

<center><img src="images/dplyr.jpeg" height="500px" width="650px" /></center>

---

# For example...

- Say I wan't to look at just the mTBI participants
```{r}
COMBINED_COG_PhD %>%
  dplyr::filter(group=="mtbi") %>%
  dplyr::select(code, age, sex, education) %>%
  knitr::kable("html")
```

---
# dplyr (cont)..

## Explore your data
- ggplot2 is a **magical** graphics package specifically built to help you iteratively create customized graphs.

## The grammar of graphics..

To make the most basic graph, you need to tell R three things:

1. You're using ggplot

2. What data is used to create the graph 

3. What type of graph you want to create


...everything beyond that is optional customization.

---
So code to make the most basic scatterplot for might look something like..

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo= FALSE}
  np_visit <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/data-vis/master/np_visit.csv"))

  g<- np_visit %>% 
  dplyr::filter(park_name == "Dinosaur National Monument")

```


```{r dino_graph, eval = TRUE, echo= TRUE}

  ggplot(g, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point()
```
---

- Then you can customise your graph based on combining dplyr, the pipe operator and ggplot2
```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.align ='center', fig.height= 5}
  np_visit %>% # 
  dplyr::filter(state == "CA" & type == "National Park") %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(park_name, year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Annual Visitors") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("California National Parks Visitation") +
  facet_wrap(~park_name)
```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo= FALSE, fig.align ='center', fig.height= 8, fig.width=7}
  np_visit %>% # 
  dplyr::filter(state == "CA" & type == "National Park") %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(park_name, year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Annual Visitors") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("California National Parks Visitation") +
  facet_wrap(~park_name)
```

## The pipe operator %>%

- The "pipe" (%>%) is another friend  well worth learning how to use

- The pipe will forward a value, or the result of an expression, into the next function call/expression. 

```{r the pipe, eval = TRUE, echo= TRUE}

# For instance a function to filter data can be written as:
iris %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Species) %>%
  dplyr::summarize_if(is.numeric, mean) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  gather(measure, value, -Species) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(value)

```
Its legible in that you can read this as you would read normal prose (we read the %>% as “and then”): “take iris and then group by and then summarise and then ungroup and then arrange.

---
##  Analysis: Write your own *fun*-ctions

- Make the computer do the hard work
- I.e take a manual job like extracting values from presentation output in excel
        Turn this -->  x 60 participants x 3 timepoints x 3 conditions

<center><img src="images/excel_sheet.jpeg" height="400px"  width="550px" /></center>

---

## Using this....
```{r, function example, eval= FALSE}
load_ds_behav <- function(filename) {
  if (!file.exists(filename)) {
    warning(paste("Missing", filename))
    return(NULL)
  }
  pathA <- dirname(filename)
  folder1 <- basename(pathA)
  id<- folder1  ## pull apart file name with bash style
  
  df <- read.table(filename,header = TRUE, sep = "\t",fileEncoding= "ASCII") # create a dataframe
  
  df <- mutate(df, sourcefile=filename, id=id, 
               timepoint=timepoint, condition=condition)

  acc_data<-sum(df$Accuracy=="Correct")
  df<-mutate(df, accuracy=acc_data)
  df<-select(df, id, timepoint, condition, accuracy) 
  df<-head(df,1) 
  return(df) } # Calculate accuracy and return df
  
  ## Now we have it working, instantly apply to everything
  ds_df <- map_df(ds_behav_files, load_ds_behav)
```

---
## Into this.....
```{r, dataframe example, eval = TRUE, echo= FALSE}
load("~/Documents/PHD-Data-Analysis/PHD-Data-Analysis/Analysis/Data/ds_df_wide.Rdata")
load("~/Documents/PHD-Data-Analysis/PHD-Data-Analysis/Analysis/Data/ds_df_narrow.Rdata")

knitr::kable(ds_df_wide[1:12, 1:10], "html")
```

---
## Or this...

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo= FALSE}
knitr::kable(ds_df_narrow[1:10, 1:4], "html") 
```
